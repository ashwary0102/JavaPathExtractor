# JavaPathExtractor
This is used to sample the entire set of leaf to leaf AST paths for a Java method,
with the method name as file name and method content as the file content. The
output file contains paths separated by a comma and the continuity within a path
is denoted by a pipe.
The Java code is packaged as a Maven project.
